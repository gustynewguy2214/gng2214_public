The most interesting of these files are from CAP5610: Machine Learning (Graduate Level)

As an undergrad I worked with a graduate student and a PHD student as group members for our class's final project. Our project involved exploring whether or not a selfie could be classified as being good quality or bad quality using traditional machine learning methods (Naive Bayes classifier, SVMs, Logistic Regression, etc.) and Convolutional Neural Networks (custom architectures and the heavy hitters of VGG19, MobileNet, ResNet30, etc.). The files involved with the project are below: 

1. Look_for_missing_files.ipynb: I had difficulties uploading my group's image data set to my Google Drive, so this was a quick script written to check if all the images had been uploaded correctly.
2. 5610_cp2_self.ipynb: Exploration into using OpenCV for our project. The idea was to remove image rotation as a variable to improve image classification. However, given the limited time we had remaining in the semester, and the wide variety of images (the majority might not have visible lines to be used for straightening), it was decided by the group to not implement the ideas shown here. In a more uniform dataset however, this might have worked.

The other 5610 files are for exploring decision trees, random forests, and recommender systems.

The remaining files are associated with CAP4611: Algorithms for Machine Learning, focusing mainly on classification and regression. Regression for California house prices, and classification of lung damage using a CNN.
