I did the bonus problem implementation.

NOTICE:

Please start with a fresh session (as in 0 active sessions to start), and clear out cookies in the tomcat manager and inside the app itself (after one or more runs). Stop / start / restart the project before evaluation. This is required due to Tomcat caching everything it finds and leaving behind previous runs of the servlet.

Dr. Llewellyn has given permission to submit without this issue being resolved, as this is an issue that goes beyond the scope of the project.
